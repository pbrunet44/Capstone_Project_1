# Event Scheduler - React Frontend

The client-side application, which uses React to interact with the user and access the API.

## Setup

In this folder, use `npm install` to install the frontend dependencies.

Create a copy of `.env.sample` and name it `.env`. Set the environment variable `VITE_SERVER_URL` to the URL where you're hosting the backend.

## Running

Use `npm run test` to run tests.

Use `npm run dev` to run the client without building.

Use `npm num build` to prepare the client for production. The built frontend outputs to the `dist` directory.
