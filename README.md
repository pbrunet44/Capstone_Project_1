Capstone Project for Springboard Software Engineering Course

# Step 1: Project Ideas
My mentor and I have narrowed this project down to two ideas, one of which has a possible extension.
## Scheduling App
A website that people can use to coordinate schedules for meetups, business meetings, study sessions, or other events.
The event organizer could create a link to share with attendees. After they reply, the organizer can see a visualization of which times work best.
The organizer can either plan for a weekly event, or an event that happens once on a specific week.
The attendees would click on the link and enter their availability on a 1 week calendar broken up into 15 minute intervals. 
There would be 5 "brushes" they could use to mark their availability: 
- completely free
- might be free (contingent on things like boss approving time off or how late another event might start)
- minor inconvenience (could come, but not ideal)
- major inconvenience (could come, but have to make some compromises)
- can't come no matter what

The attendees could also leave comments explaining a particular availability slot if they like.
The app will weigh the number of people available for a certain time, and the type of availability, to create a heat map of best days and times.

## Quiz/Studying App
A website where users can submit quizzes and flashcards that they can use to study, and share those quizzes and flashcards with other users.
Users will be able to search for different flashcards and quizzes by subject.
Users will be able to import and export quizzes and flashcards as JSON files so they can backup their data. This ensures they have access to their study materials if they are not able to access the site.
Users will be able to create accounts to save and favorite quizzes and flashcards made by other users.

### Quiz/Studying App Extension: Decenteralization
The app could support selecting which server/"access node" they will use to upload and download content. 
Users could clone the repository to create their own access node and self-host their content. Optionally, users could make their access node password protected.
Organizations such as universities could use this feature to host their studying resources on their own servers.
